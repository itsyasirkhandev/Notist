## Style Guidelines:

- Initial design in grayscale to focus on spacing and contrast.
- Defined palette with 8-10 shades of grey and 5-10 shades of a primary brand color. The primary brand color is HSL(210, 80%, 40%), which translates to RGB Hex #1976D2, a classic blue suggesting stability.
- Use the primary brand color for interactive elements, teaching users what is clickable.
- All text must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
- Background color: Very light blue, almost white, with HSL(210, 20%, 95%) which translates to RGB Hex #F0F5FA.
- Accent color: Analogous to the primary blue, a vibrant, desaturated purple at HSL(240, 60%, 50%), which translates to RGB Hex #5A56E9; this vivid hue adds a touch of modernity and contrast.
- Focus on essential features, removing unnecessary elements for simplicity.
- Emphasize important elements with contrast, size, and weight to guide the user's eye.
- Group related items together and align elements along invisible lines for a structured design.
- Embrace ample whitespace to frame content, improve focus, and give the design room to breathe.
- Use one single sans-serif typeface for the interface to ensure legibility; recommendation is 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif
- Use a predefined and consistent type scale (e.g., 12px, 14px, 16px, 18px, 24px, 32px).
- Body text should be 16px-18px with a line-height of at least 1.5.
- Use only regular (400-500) and bold (600-700) font weights.
- Use the react-icons library for all icons.
- Use Tailwind's built-in transitions for simple effects.
- Use GSAP for more advanced animations.
